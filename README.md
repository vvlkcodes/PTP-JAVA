# 🚀 **PTP-JAVA – Practice Track for Java**

A curated collection of Java programs created during my **1st Year – 2nd Semester** to strengthen my fundamentals in **programming, logic building, and problem-solving**.

This repository includes everything from **basic syntax** to **structured problem sets**, making it valuable for **beginners** learning Java step-by-step.

---

## ✅ **About the Repository**

This project is a **practice playground** where I explored:

- **Core Java syntax**
- **Conditional statements**
- **Loops & iterations**
- **Functions & recursion**
- **Arrays & strings**
- **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**
- **Logical & mathematical problem-solving**

It represents the beginning of my journey into Java development and my growth as a programmer.
