Arrays in java:
============
How to declare the array in java?
data-type[] arrayname = new datatype[size of the array];
There are 4 ways in java
int n[size]; //or
int[] n;
//simple declaration and initialization.
//declare first initialize next
//using the new 
//declare first initialize by i(using the loop)
Arrays: 
	It is a secondary data structure which holds multiple values of same type.
	size is always fixed.

		where: Type refers to the datatype

Types of arrays:
	1.Single dimensional
		1.Initialization
		2.Declaration of the array
	2.Multi dimensional
		jagged array
--> The Multi Dimensional Arrays:
		The array of arrays is called as the multi dimensional arrays
		The most important rule in the Multi dimensional arrays is the first element (or) the rows slot should be filled
--> The Jagged Arrays:
		All the sizes of the sub-arrays are not same.
		Or the sizes of the arrays are unusual
		Then, they are called as Jagged arrays
		We mostly don't use it
